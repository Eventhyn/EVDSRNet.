This is the official implementation of the paper "EFFICIENT JOINT VIDEO DENOISING AND SUPER-RESOLUTION" which is accepted at IEEE ICIP2023. The paper can be officially viewed at [IEEE Xplore](https://www.google.com).

# Overall structure

In this paper, we present two versions of our proposed method, one is noted as medium and another is noted as large. 

The trade-off between the performance and computation cost is parameterized by N_b and N_c where N_b is the number of blocks in the super-resolution network and N_c is the feature dimension of these blocks. 

Our medium model adopts N_b = 8 and N_c = 128 where large model adopts N_b = 16 and N_c = 256.
